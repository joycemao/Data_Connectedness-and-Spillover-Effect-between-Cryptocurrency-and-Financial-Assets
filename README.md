Datas used in &lt;Connectedness and Spillover Effect between Cryptocurrency and Financial Assets>
## This repository contains two CSV files that are used in the analysis of the paper "Connectedness and Spillover Effect between Cryptocurrency and Financial Assets". The data is available for public use and includes information on stock returns and volatility returns.

### Data
## The two CSV files in this repository are named "return.csv" and "volatility.csv". The "return.csv" file contains the stock return data used in the paper, while the "volatility.csv" file contains the volatility return data. The data is organized by date and includes the following columns:

#### Date: the date of the observation
#### BTC	: the daily returns of Bitcoin
#### ETH	: the daily returns of Ether
#### BNB	: the daily returns of Binance
#### CCI30	: the daily returns of  CCI30 Index

#### Gold	: the daily returns of Dow Jones Commodity Gold Index
#### Engergy	: the daily returns of Dow Jones Commodity Energy Index

#### The "volatility.csv" file includes the volatility data used in the analysis. It has the same format as the "return.csv" file, but includes the daily volatility of each asset.

## Data use permission
#### I wrote a letter to inquire whether it is possible to use the data from the source website for analysis and writing a paper, and received a positive response.
